I believe i made this mostly from ripping it from youtube projects and code online.

it used to just be a pxel colour checker that would take a screen shot of the screen - mostly a minecraft window
when the pixel colour depth changed it would reel the fishing rod in

i did it seems attempt to  rip and mesh some code from a neural networks forum of sorts it seems to try and mesh them together
to allow for it to be done with more accuracy
rather than a timed checker
